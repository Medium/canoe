# S3 Utils

S3's missing utilities for Node.js. Built on the [AWS Node SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js).

## Install

`npm install s3-utils --save`

## Usage

Create a new `s3Utils` instance by passing an instance of `AWS.S3` from the `aws-sdk` module.

```javascript
var AWS = require('aws-sdk'),
  S3Utils = require('s3-utils');

var s3 = new AWS.S3();
var s3utils = new S3Utils(s3);
```

## Methods

### createWriteStream

A Node 0.10-friendly writable stream interface ("streams2") for uploading objects to S3.

#### Usage

Creates a writable stream for a given S3 bucket/key. The stream will be returned immediately and also passed to an optional callback.

The stream will be writable when it's returned, but not actually ready to send data to S3 yet (data will be buffered internally in the meantime). If you use the immediately returned stream, be sure to respect `false`-y return values, as Node's `readable.pipe()` does. The stream will be fully ready when the callback is run.

The stream will emit a `writable` event when it's ready to send data to S3.

Basic usage:

```javascript
var writableStream = s3Utils.createWriteStream({
  Bucket: 'bucket-name',
  Key: 'file/name'
});
writableStream.write(stuff);
writableStream.end();
```

#### Example: Piping a large file

```javascript
// Create a stream and use it immediately
var writeable = s3Utils.createS3WriteStream({
  Bucket: 'random-access-memories',
  Key: 'instant.crush'
});


// For fun, let's keep track of how much memory we need.
// We'll print the memory peak once the upload finishes.
// Peak will stay fairly consistent regardless of file size.
var maxMemory = 0;
setInterval(function() {
  maxMemory = Math.max(maxMemory, process.memoryUsage().heapUsed);
}, 100);

writeable.on('end', function(data) {
  console.log('Peak memory heap usage was ' + maxMemory + ' bytes');
  process.exit();
});

// Imagine you have some massive file you want to upload that doesn't fit into memory
fs.createReadStream('./random-access-memories.log').pipe(writeable);
```

#### Example: Writing chunks of data

```javascript
// Create a stream and wait to use it in a callback
var s3Params = {Bucket: 'random-access-memories', Key: 'instant.crush'};
s3Utils.createWriteStream(s3Params, function(err, writable) {
  if (err) return;

  writable.write("And we will never be alone again\n");
  writable.write("'Cause it doesn't happen every day\n");
  writable.write("Kinda counted on you being a friend\n");
  writable.write("Kinda given up on giving away\n");
  writable.write("Now I thought about what I wanna say\n");
  writable.write("But I never really know where to go\n");
  writable.write("So I chained myself to a friend\n");
  writable.write("'Cause I know it unlocks like a door...");
  writable.end("\n");
});
```


## Testing

Tests use Mocha, and can be run with `npm test`. For development, you should run `grunt watch` to automatically run tests, run JS Hint, and update documentaiton.

Questions, comments, bug reports, and pull requests are all welcome.  Submit them at [the project on GitHub](https://github.com/Obvious/simple-storage-streams/).  If you haven't contributed to an [Obvious](http://github.com/Obvious/) project before please head over to the [Open Source Project](https://github.com/Obvious/open-source#note-to-external-contributors) and fill out an OCLA (it should be pretty painless).

Bug reports that include steps-to-reproduce (including code) are the best. Even better, make them in the form of pull requests.
